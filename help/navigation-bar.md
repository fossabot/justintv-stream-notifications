By typing "live" in the navigation bar, you can directly access the streams and
channels tracked by the extension.

Everything typed after "live " is used to search through all channels and the
top results are then suggested. To navigate to a channel, select the suggestion
or type "live <number>" where the number is the one shown in gray in the suggestion.

This number will stay the same. This means to navigate to the channel with ID 1,
all that is required is to type "live 1" and the channel will always be opened.
