## What is Livestreamer?
[Livestreamer](http://livestreamer.io) is a command-line program that opens
streams with a native video player like VLC.

## How do I use Livestreamer with this extension?
Go to the extension settings and set the stream URL copy pattern to the livestreamer
command you want to run to open a stream. This would for example look like `livestreamer {URL} source`.

You can then copy that command for a channel from the context menu in the panel
and then execute it in a console to launch Livestreamer.
