    <h2>Enjoy the extension?</h2>
    <p>Since you've already had the extension installed you seem to like the extension. It would be great if you would recommend the extension to your friends or watchers! <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/justintv-stream-notificatio/reviews/add">Leaving a review on AMO</a> is also a great way to tell me what you like and what you dislike!</p>
